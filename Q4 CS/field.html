			<h3 class="med">MEDICAL BIOTECH</h3>
			<p id="medbio">Medical biotechnology is a branch of medicine that uses living cells and cell materials to research and then produce pharmaceutical and diagnosing products. These products help treat and prevent diseases.</p>
			<h3 class="pharm">PHARM BIOTECH</h3>
			<p id="pharm">Pharmaceutical biotechnology is a relatively new and growing field in which the principles of biotechnology are applied to the development of drugs. A majority of therapeutic drugs in the current market are bioformulations, such as antibodies, nucleic acid products and vaccines. </p>
			<h3 class="plant">PLANT BIOTECH</h3>
			<p id="plant">Plant biotechnology is a set of techniques used to adapt plants for specific needs or opportunities. Situations that combine multiple needs and opportunities are common.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="second">
			<h3 class="cell">CELL BIOTECH</h3>
			<p id="cell">Cellular biotechnology is a field of biotechnology that develops tools and therapeutics through modification and engineering of stem cells. Cellular biotechnology is important in regenerative medicine.</p>
			<h3 class="ferm">FERMENT BIOTECH</h3>
			<p id="ferm">Fermentation is biotechnology in which desirable microorganisms are used in the production of value-added products of commercial importance.</p>
			<h3 class="env">ENVIRONMENT BIOTECH</h3>
			<p id="env">Environmental biotechnology is biotechnology that is applied to and used to study the natural environment. Environmental biotechnology could also imply that one try to harness biological process for commercial uses and exploitation.</p>
